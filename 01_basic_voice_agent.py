Building a Voice AI Assistant with LiveKit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a real-time voice AI assistant using the LiveKit Agents framework. Our assistant will listen to user input, process it using a Large Language Model (LLM), and respond with synthesized speech.

We will be integrating several powerful AI models:
* STT (Speech-to-Text): Deepgram Nova-3
* LLM (Large Language Model): OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini
* TTS (Text-to-Speech): Cartesia Sonic-2

# --- Step 1: Environment Setup and Imports ---
# First, we need to import the necessary modules. We use `dotenv` to load our API keys
# (like `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) from a local `.env` file. We also 
# import the core classes from `livekit.agents`, including the `AgentServer`, and 
# specific plugins for noise cancellation.

import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from livekit.agents import (
    Agent,
    AgentServer,
    AgentSession,
    JobContext,
    RoomInputOptions,
    cli,
)
from livekit.plugins import noise_cancellation, silero

# Load environment variables containing API keys
load_dotenv()


# --- Step 2: Defining the Assistant Agent ---
# Next, we define our core logic by subclassing the `Agent` class. In the `__init__` 
# method, we provide the system instructions that dictate the assistant's persona 
# and behavior.

class Assistant(Agent):
    """
    The Assistant class defines the core behavior and system prompt 
    for our voice AI.
    """
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions="You are a helpful voice AI assistant.",
        )


# --- Step 3: Configuring the Agent Server ---
# Now we instantiate our `AgentServer`. This object is responsible for managing 
# the incoming agent workers and their sessions.

# Initialize the Agent Server
server = AgentServer()


# --- Step 4: Configuring the Agent Session ---
# Next, we define the `entrypoint` function and decorate it with `@server.rtc_session()`, 
# which registers this function to handle incoming RTC sessions (like a user joining a room).
#
# Notice the `ctx: JobContext` parameter. The `JobContext` provides essential information 
# about the current job your agent is handling. It grants your agent access to the specific 
# LiveKit `Room` object it is connecting to, details about the participants, and methods 
# to accept or manage the connection.
#
# Inside the entrypoint, we instantiate an `AgentSession` and configure the pipeline 
# of AI models that will process the audio. We specify the models for STT, LLM, and TTS.

@server.rtc_session()
async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    """
    The entrypoint is triggered when the worker connects to a LiveKit room.
    """
    # 1. Configure the AI pipeline models
    session = AgentSession(
        stt="deepgram/nova-3",
        llm="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
        tts="cartesia/sonic-2",
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
    )

    # --- Step 5: Starting the Session and Connecting ---
    # Once the session is configured, we need to start it by passing in our `Assistant` 
    # instance, the LiveKit room object, and any input options.
    #
    # To ensure the AI doesn't get confused by background noise or its own voice echoing, 
    # we apply Background Voice Cancellation (BVC) using the `noise_cancellation` plugin. 
    # Finally, we establish the connection to the room.

    # 2. Start the session with our Assistant and Room options
    await session.start(
        agent=Assistant(),
        room=ctx.room,
        room_input_options=RoomInputOptions(
            noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.BVC(),
        ),
    )

    # 3. Connect the agent to the room
    await ctx.connect()


# --- Step 6: Running the Application ---
# Finally, to make this script executable, we use the LiveKit CLI to run our application, 
# simply passing our configured `server` instance to `cli.run_app()`.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setup standard logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    
    # Run the worker app using the AgentServer
    cli.run_app(server)
